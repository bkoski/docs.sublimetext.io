title: How to use Sublime for TypeScript development
---

Sublime Text 4 [ships with built-in TypeScript syntax](https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-4).

This built-in support includes highlighting plus core Sublime [completion](../extensibility/completions.html) and [“Go to Definition”](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/indexing.html) behaviors.

### LSP

If you're looking for inline docs, advanced autocomplete and refactor tools, you’ll want to install the [`LSP`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) and [`LSP-typescript`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-typescript) packages.


LSP (Language Server Protocol) is the [same underlying technology](https://langserver.org) used in VSCode and other clients with rich TypeScript support. The [Sublime LSP project](https://lsp.sublimetext.io/) offers similar support for [many different languages](https://lsp.sublimetext.io/language_servers/).

### ESLint

If you’re using LSP, add [`LSP-eslint`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-eslint) for general linting behaviors.

Alternatively, you can get ESLint support by combining the [`SublimeLinter`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter) and [`SublineLinter-eslint`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-eslint) packages.


### Options for Sublime Text 3

  * The [`TypeScript Syntax`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TypeScript%20Syntax) package can be used for basic syntax support in ST3.
  * [`LSP-typescript`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-typescript) is also compatible with ST3.
  * Microsoft’s [`TypeScript`](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TypeScript) package [github](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin) is an alternative that includes both syntax support and LSP behaviors.
